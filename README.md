The LeaseWeb maturity model for DevOps teams
=============================

This is the maturity model for devops teams as we use it in [LeaseWeb](http://www.leaseweb.com), and some parts might be quite specific to our organisation. Yet we feel it's a good thing to share this model and welcome any feedback or collaboration on it.

How the model works:
-------------
The model consists of four categories of requirements (links below). Within a category, a team progresses through four levels, starting at “Initial Level” which essentially means none of the requirements have been checked, from here a team progresses through “Basic Level” and “Intermediate Level” to achieve the “Target Level” - our ideal DevOps team.
